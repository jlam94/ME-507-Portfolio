 * The motivation for this project is to build a prototype for a full-scale basketball-playing robot.
 * The project will start with a small-scale version to test the concept and gather insights for future improvements.
 * This approach will provide an opportunity to develop customized PCBAs that can control the robot for its intended purposes.
