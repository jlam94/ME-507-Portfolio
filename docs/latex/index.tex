The motivation for this project is to build a prototype for a full-\/scale basketball-\/playing robot. The project will start with a small-\/scale version to test the concept and gather insights for future improvements. This approach will provide an opportunity to develop customized PCBAs that can control the robot for its intended purposes.\hypertarget{index_req}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Requirements}{Requirements}}\label{index_req}
